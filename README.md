# Crack-Hack
First of all, we made front-end and backend differently.
Dockerfiles for both and then docker-compose.yml.

I found out .yar file source on google,
after downloading it and compiling it in my python code,
I tested it on a malware.
It worked from terminal(I used a malware/code which gave 10% harmfulness),
which is not that high risk.

then I started making backend for it,
and yes by using different files and combining it
in an order, I then started making frontend which just do my work,
not more than that.
and after both being ready I made docker file for both differently.
docker-compose.yml.

and then I went to docker-desktop where I made image.

THE ERROR WHERE CURRENTLY I AM :

frontend is accepting file and making request at localhost:80/
backend is accepting folder on localhost:8000/upload/
and after that it will store in localhose:8000/scan/
from which python library will scan it.




Yes, my code scan every ransomware,.pdf,bitcoin miner,.exe.



But frontend will accept only .exe file now as that was my base target.
